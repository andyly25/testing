#Andy's portfolio website in progress

Goal is to make a website with links to my projects and github repository
Possibly include other things as well

##Goal:
- refresh/improve on Html/CSS
- making a blog portfolio
	- where I can edit posts, but others cannot
- showcase what I have done

I'm using Koala for sass

There is a repository for my Ruby on Rails website called
[portfolioSite](https://github.com/birisora/portfolioSite)
