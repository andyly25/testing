###Using Node Modules
- include them using require function
- file based modules:
	- require('./module_name') //you need specify relative path to the file
- Core and external modules:
	- require('module_name')
	- can find in ../node_modules until found

Normally there will be an index.js file as the starting file for the node module. 
- this will be the root if all files and folders

There will also be a package.json file
- there is a specification called "main", so if you hate using index.js as default you can name something else here.
- semantic versioning by <Major ver>.<Minor ver>.<Patch> 
	- npm can specify acceptable package version:
		- exact: npm install express@4.00
		- patch acceptable: npm install express@"~4.0.0"
		- Minor version acceptable: npm install express@"^4.0.0"
inside there are dependencies:
- containing the list of all node modules on which this particular node module is dependent on.
