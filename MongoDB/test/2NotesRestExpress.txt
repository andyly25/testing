#Rest API
- REST: Representational State Transfer
	- browser to communicate with server over HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
	- When you load a website's homepage, sends HTTP request to their servers
		- then sends back an HTTP response
		- instructions on how to render the page
		- combo of three distinct things
			1. verb: like GET
			2. Resource: /home analogous to file path
			3. body: optional JSON data
	- Uses HTTP to manage state, using CRUD
		- Create, Read, Update, Delete

###Dependency Injection: 
- software engineering practice to break your code into small, easy to maintain chunks
	- separate initialization code from business logic
		- rest API never worry e.g. set up mongoose models
	- key to writing AngularJS code
