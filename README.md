# Andy's Testing Repository
Here is where I'll practice data structures and algorithms of a variety of languages. Although I may try attempting other things as well.

Goals: 
Better understanding of data structures and algorithms.
Programming better
Learning a variety of tools to use
Data mining and presentations
and more to come (currently motivated to try 3D modeling again)
