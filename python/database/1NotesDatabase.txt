Note I'm downloading [sqlite browser]('http://sqlitebrowser.org/')

###Relational Databases:
- model data by storing rows and columns in tables
- ability to retrieve data from tables and relationship between other tables in query

####Terms

- table (Relation): contains attributes and tuples
- Tuple (row): set of field that represents an object and info about object
- Attribute (column): one or more elements of data corresponding to object represented by row
- Object: pysical object or concepts

###SQL
- Structured Query Language: language used to issues commands to db
	- create table, retrieve data, insert, delete ...
	- This is CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete)

###Database Model
- db model/schema is structure or format of a db.
	- application of data model when used with db management system
- Three Major DB Management Systems:
	- Oracle: large, enterprise scale, commercial
	- MySql: Simpler, fast and scalable, commercial open source
		- There's a MariaDB
	- SqlServer: nice from Microsoft
	- Others are SQLite, Postgress and more
		- SQLite is an embedded DB
			- part of a software, built in

```SQL
/* Single Table example */
CREATE TABLE Users(
	name VARCHAR(128),
	email VARCHAR(128)
)

```

######SQL Insert
- insert statment inserts a row into a table
```SQL
INSERT INTO Users(name,email) VALUES ('danny', 'danny@gmail.com')
```

######SQL Delete
- Deletes a row in a table based on selection criteria
```SQL
DELETE FROM Users WHERE email='danny@gmail.com'
```

######SQL Update
- Allow updates to a field with a where clause
```SQL
UPDATE Users SET name="John" WHERE email='yolo@gmail.com'
```

######SQL Retrieving Records
- Select statment retrieves group of records
	- with WHERE, you can retrieve all or subset of records
```SQL
SELECT*FROM Users WHERE email='yolo@gmail.com'
```
######Sorting with ORDER BY
- You can add an ORDER BY clause to SELECT statements to get results sorted (asc or desc)
```SQL
SELECT*FROM Users ORDER BY name
```
